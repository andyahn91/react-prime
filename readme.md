Library to effortlessly convert your non-SSR React applications into responsive, SSR React applications.
https://ss-react.github.io/react-prime/

## Please Note

This library has been developed to work with Create-React-Apps exclusively. <br />
Dependencies that rely on the window object before checking if it exists will not be compatable with React-Prime.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Local installation

```
npm install --save react-prime
```
Then, install the required dependencies
```
npm i inquirer @babel/core @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/register react-frontload react-helmet react-loadable md5-file
```


### Server-Side Rendering

The process of SSR with our library has been automated through a CLI.

- Add a script into your package.json and run the script.

```
scripts: {
  "prime": "prime"
}
```
```
npm run prime
```

## Deployment

Upon answering all of the CLI questions, a ```primessr``` directory is created which contains five files: 
- index.js
- server.js
- primeServer.js
- primeCompare.html

and either
- returnHTML.js

or, if you have Redux
- returnReduxHTML.js

Then, an SSR version of your application is automatically hosted on ```http://localhost:8080```.

## Performance Testing

To view side by side comparison of CSR and SSR renders:
```
prime:compare
```

While Prime compare server is running, execute the following to generate Lighthouse reports:
```
prime:CSRreport
```
```
prime:SSRreport
```
